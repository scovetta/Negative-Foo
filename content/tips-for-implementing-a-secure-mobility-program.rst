As we approach the end of 2012, nearly all large enterprises have at
least partially adopted smartphones and tablets for business purposes
[`1`_\ ]. Nearly three-quarters of them have started to implement Bring
Your Own Device programs [`2`_\ ], and about half of all business
executives are using tablets for work purposes [`3`_\ ]. As device
adoption continues to grow, the importance of implementing a secure
enterprise mobility program cannot be understated. There are many
aspects that should be included in a successful program; two of the most
important include the use of a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution
to protect enterprise data from loss via untrusted devices and the
implementation of a process for developing and deploying secure mobile
applications.

Mobile Device/Data Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Over the past few years, MDM solutions have gained significant traction
in the enterprise, and should now be considered critical components of
an enterprise security program. Choosing the right MDM solution for your
organization can be a difficult task, especially at the frenetic pace of
the mobile market. Here are a few tips to help you get started:

#. Ensure that the solution provider has a track record of supporting a
   wide range of current mobile devices, even if you only plan to
   support specific platforms right now. As new devices come on to the
   market, you want to be sure that the solution will grow with your
   needs.
#. Base your MDM configuration on existing security policies, especially
   for data encryption, password strength, and remote wiping.
#. Consider using a transparent, on-demand VPN. Since many of your users
   will be accessing mobile applications from untrusted wireless
   locations, the use of a VPN to secure traffic out of the device can
   serve as a stop-gap against vulnerable applications.

Mobile Application Development & Deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This can be a difficult time to choose a mobile application development
architecture, with standards like HTML 5 evolving at a dizzying pace and
device capabilities and form-factors advancing just as rapidly.
Regardless of the architecture you choose to implement, itâ€™s important
to ensure that enterprise data remains protected on mobile devices. Here
are a few tips to help make that happen:

#. Include mobile applications and API endpoints in existing
   vulnerability management processes. Remember that mobile applications
   can be affected by most of the same vulnerabilities as traditional
   desktop and web-applications.
#. Maintain a comprehensive security threat model for mobility. This
   should include jail-broken devices, platform-based malware,
   infrastructure espionage, as well as attacks against certificate
   authorities and other trusted third-parties.
#. Develop a common set of hardened mobile software components for
   functions like authentication, caching, error logging, and data
   sharing.
#. Leverage an MDM solution to securely deploy applications, but do not
   rely on an application being installed on a device as the sole method
   of authentication.

The enterprise mobility space has expanded enormously over the past few
years, and shows no sign of stopping. Threats to enterprise data
continue to increase, and protection of that data is imperative. The use
of a comprehensive MDM solution and a secure mobile development program
can significantly reduce the risk inherent in these powerful mobile
devices and help your organization to realize their benefits.
