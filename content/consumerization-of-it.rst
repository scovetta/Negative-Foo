Long ago, while many of you were perhaps in school,
corporate workers would arrive at the office and use leading-edge
technology (e.g. mainframes, personal computers, pagers, photocopiers,
“laser” printers)—technology that was far superior to anything they had
in their house. Today, the opposite is true.

The last decade has seen a dramatic departure from this; most workers
give better equipment to their children than they use at their desk.
Product companies have helped to drive this, with the latest “gotta
have” gadgets moving infiltrating the board room and lunch room alike
with a vigor that caught many of us by surprise. Have you waited on a
long line for the latest Apple device? Have you tried to get a great
deal on a gadget on Black Friday?

The term *Consumerization of IT* (COIT) usually refers to the trend of
technology to emerge in the consumer market and then later by the
enterprise/business market. To me, it also means a drive toward using
consumer-oriented devices instead of the ones on “the corporate list”.
It’s as much about choice and style as it is about the commoditization
and standardization.  The COIT movement hasn’t peaked, but many
employees expect to be able to use devices based on personal choice
rather than corporate standards. Are you an Apple Fanboy? You can get a
Macbook. Like Dell? That works. Prefer Android? We’ve got you covered.

`Marc LeShay`_ gave me a great insight a few years ago: **The reason
that people are willing to camp out overnight next to an Apple Store in
order to be first in line to get an iPhone is because Apple has been
absolutely masterful in getting people to create anemotional
connectionto their products. **

This phenomenon occurs with other device to be sure, but I don’t think
there’s another brand out there that as many devoted followers.

The tie-in to COIT is that enterprises would be wise to consider the
emotional connection that their workers have to their environment. This
goes far beyond smartphones, tablets, and laptops to include things like
workspace, cafeteria, benefits, and company policies, but the essential
point is the same. If I treat my company-owned smartphone as though it
were my own, if it’s the first thing I check in the morning when I wake
up (even if it’s not specifically to check my work e-mail), I am more
likely to put in the extra time and effort to make whatever I am doing
at work successful.

This is really important. It’s why Google gives their employees really
good equipment, even if it’s not an Android device.

What kind of equipment do you use at work? Do you have better equipment
at home? I’d love to hear your thoughts.
